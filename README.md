# Java
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

## Origin and History
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.
<!-- ### Goals in creation of Java Language
1.  It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
2.  It must be robust and secure.
3.  It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
4.  It must execute with high performance.
5.  It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.

## Compilation and Running
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support. This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End-users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their device for standalone Java applications or a web browser for Java applets.

Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and networking.

The use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables. Just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java's Hotspot compiler is actually two compilers in one; and with GraalVM (included in e.g. Java 11, but removed as of Java 16) allowing tiered compilation. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular platform it is to run on by a Java virtual machine (JVM) for it, which translates the Java bytecode into the platform's machine language.

<!-- ## Difference between JDK, JRE and JVM
| JDK | JRE | JVM|
|---|---|---|
| Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed in Java development. | JRE stands for “Java Runtime Environment” and may also be written as “Java RTE.” The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application; it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and supporting files. | JVM stands for JAVA Virtual Machine. A specification where the working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. But implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm. Its implementation has been provided by Sun and other companies. |
| JDK (Java Development Kit) is a Kit that provides the environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program. JDK is a kit(or package) that includes two things Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs) and JRE (to execute your java program). | JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that provides an environment to only run(not develop) the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by those who only want to run Java programs that are end-users of your system. |  JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both. Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an interpreter. |

## Syntax
The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language. All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not objects for performance reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the printf method).

Unlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces.

Java uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */.
### Hello World Example
#### Code
```java
public class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
#### Output
```
Hello World!
```
## Identifiers
In programming languages, identifiers are used for identification purposes. In Java, an identifier can be a class name, method name, variable name, or label.
```java
public class Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a = 20;
    }
}
```
In the above code, we have 5 identifiers namely :
1. Test : class name.
2. main : method name.
3. String : predefined class name.
4. args : variable name.
5. a :  variable name.

## Variables
Variable in Java is a data container that saves the data values during Java program execution. Every variable is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. Variable is a memory location name of the data.

It can be clearly understood by this image:

### Some variable declarations
```java
float simpleInterest; 
// Declaring float variable
```
```java
int time = 10, speed = 20; 
// Declaring and Initializing integer variable
```
```java
char var = 'h'; 
// Declaring and Initializing character variable
```

## Object and Classes
### Object
Objects are the things which are taken first in consideration while designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. An object is a real-world entity. An object is a runtime entity. The object is an entity which has state and behavior. The object is an instance of a class.

### Classes
A class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects. It can also be understood as a class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
It can consists of these things:-
1. Fields
2. Methods
3. Constructors
4. Blocks
5. Nested class and interface

#### Syntax to declare a class
```java
class <class_name>{  
    field;  
    method;  
} 
```
